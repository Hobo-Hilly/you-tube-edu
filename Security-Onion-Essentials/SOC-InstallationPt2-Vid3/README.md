This is Pt.2 of the Security Onion Installation
Instructor: Josh Brower
In Pt.1 
- we downloaded the security onion iso
- Verified the image
- created a virtual machine (With the appropriate specs according to your desired deployment mode)
- Installed the Operating System CentOS 7

Now in Pt.2 of the install we are going to ...
1. Log back into virtual machine
2. Run through the security onion setup
3. Let the install happen
4. Rebbot
5. Login a final time to make sure all of the security onion services came up and installed correctly

# So we are now starting part 2 of the install from the login screen of the Virtual Machine we created in the previous session

CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
Kernal 3.10.0-1160.53.1el7.x86_64
